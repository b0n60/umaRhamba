üõ°Ô∏è umaRhamba - Dada ngesabhokwe kumaKhumsha

Welcome to the umaRhamba cryptographic tool! Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly, and secure application for cryptographic operations. This tool is developed with the assistance of leading markup text experts and overseen by Guido van Rossum, the inventor of Python. Below, you'll find an overview of the initial idea, what this tool currently offers, our future plans, and an open invitation to contributors. üéâ

üéØ Purpose

The umaRhamba tool is designed to help users perform various cryptographic operations, including:

    Symmetric Key Ciphers: Encryption and decryption using algorithms like AES, DES, and ChaCha20.
    Asymmetric Key Ciphers: Encryption and decryption with RSA, ECDSA, and more.
    Hash Functions: Generating hashes using algorithms such as SHA-256, SHA-3, and MD5.
    Message Authentication Codes (MACs): Generating and verifying MACs using HMAC, CMAC, and GMAC.
    Encoders: Encoding and decoding data with Base64, Hex, and URL encoding.
    Obfuscation and Exporting: Obfuscating payloads and exporting them in various formats (e.g., .exe, .pdf, .docx).
    Networking Protocols: Secure communication protocols like TLS/SSL and SSH.

üöÄ Features
Current Features

    Symmetric Key Ciphers: Supports DES, 3DES, AES, Blowfish, Twofish, IDEA, RC5, RC6, RC4, Salsa20, and ChaCha20.
    Hash Functions: Supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-3, RIPEMD, and Whirlpool.

To Be Developed

    Asymmetric Key Ciphers: Planned support for RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, ECDSA, and ECDH.
    MACs: Planned support for HMAC, CMAC, and GMAC.
    Encoders: Planned support for Base64, Hex, URL encoding, and simple obfuscation.
    Obfuscation and Exporting: Allow obfuscation of payloads and export to various formats.
    Networking Protocols: Includes plans for TLS/SSL, IPsec, SSH, OpenVPN, and HTTPS.

Planned Features

    Advanced Key Management: Integration with hardware security modules (HSMs) and cloud-based key management services.
    Enhanced Password Hashing: Implementation of Argon2 for secure password hashing.
    Improved GUI: Enhanced user interface with more customization options and responsive design.
    Detailed Documentation: Comprehensive guides and API documentation using Sphinx.
    Security Audits: Regular security audits and penetration testing to ensure robustness.

üìÖ Roadmap

    Key Management Enhancements: Integrate secure key storage mechanisms and recommendations for HSMs or cloud-based key management services.
    Password Hashing: Implement Argon2 for password hashing and enhance existing hash functions.
    GUI Improvements: Use advanced GUI design principles and frameworks like PyQt6 for a modern, responsive user interface.
    Documentation: Develop detailed documentation and user guides, including setup, usage, and API documentation.
    Security Enhancements: Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to ensure the tool's robustness and security.
